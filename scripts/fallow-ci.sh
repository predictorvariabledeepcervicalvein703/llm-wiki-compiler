#
# Run fallow with the same flags GitHub Actions uses for the
# `codebase-health` job, so issues that would block PR merge are
# surfaced locally before pushing.
#
# What this mirrors (from fallow-rs/fallow@v2 action.yml + analyze.sh):
#   - bare command (runs dead-code, dupes, and health analyses together)
#   - --root .
#   - --format human (CI uses json for parsing; human is friendlier locally)
#   - --changed-since <merge-base with the canonical PR base branch>
#       (CI uses the PR base SHA; merge-base is the closest local equivalent)
#
# Fork-aware base resolution:
#   - Prefer `upstream/main` when an `upstream` remote is configured (the
#     fork-and-PR workflow described in CONTRIBUTING.md, where `origin`
#     points at the contributor's fork and `upstream` at atomicmemory/*).
#   - Fall back to `origin/main` for direct clones.
#   - When neither remote tracks main, fall back to running fallow without
#     `--changed-since` (full-tree analysis).
#
# IMPORTANT — known parity gap:
#   fallow's clone-detection has empirical platform variation. The same
#   command, fallow version, commit, and base SHA can return 0 dupes on
#   macOS arm64 and 1+ dupes on the CI Linux x64 runner. This is a
#   tooling-level limitation, not a config bug. This script catches
#   most issues most of the time, but CI remains the ground truth.
#   When CI flags a clone you can't reproduce locally, just dedupe by
#   intent and re-push.
