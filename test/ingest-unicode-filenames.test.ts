/**
 * CLI integration tests for issue #35 — non-ASCII filenames must not be
 * silently dropped on ingest.
 *
 * Before the fix, `slugify` used `\w` without the `/u` flag, which only
 * matches `[A-Za-z0-9_]`. A title like `测试文档` slugified to the empty
 * string and ingest wrote `sources/.md` — a dotfile that's easy to miss
 * and that every subsequent CJK ingest would overwrite.
 *
 * These tests exercise the full CLI subprocess so the assertion is on
 * what the user actually observes after running `llmwiki ingest`.
